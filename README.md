# Omnifood Website

This is a responsive one-page website featuring an imaginary food delivery company. It was developed as a practical tutorial during the Udemy course: [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/).

This project was developed using mainly HTML5 and CSS3. Also, animations were added using jQuery.
